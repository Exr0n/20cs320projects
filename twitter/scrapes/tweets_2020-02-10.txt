I’m liking this strategic investment from Salesforce Ventures. “Snowflake, a developer of cloud-based technology for storing and analyzing data, is now worth $12.4 billion, making it one of the most valuable venture-backed companies in Silicon Valley.” 
No cap. You guys got a great squad, so great that you cheated to win a title. You'll be relevant for a while, but unless you use next-level technology, you going ringless.
Even with all the technology and your network supporting your business, at the center of it all is you. And you need a high degree of self-reliance to make it all work, day after day. 
It’s crazy we got all this technology but refuse to better the world everybody so fucking selfish we can’t even save the world we live In Everybody so fuckin hateful we barely can cooperate but in the end we gone suffer at our own hands so live it up while you can

Your species finds my species, grants it technology and FTL travel, "uplifts it", becomes its patrons. In exchange, my species serves yours for ten thousand years. The humans of Terra were like, "that's a dumb system," and uplifted the great apes and cetaceans.

If people are already using the technology you are thinking is new, day in, day out - it’s not new . It’s the minimum standard. We are supposed to be preparing students for the future, jobs that don’t exist. How can we do that without embracing change and technology. How? #fgs

That's the nature of technology. Most anything that comes along can easily be abused, and a lot of people fear it. I'm not saying you're WRONG to feel that way, to an extent I agree, but I feel like this kinda stuff needs to be more developed before anyone can say yay or nay.
