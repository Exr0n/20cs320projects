# Classic Neuroevolution

Started by evolving weights, and polcies to update weights as an alternative to backprop
    these approaches had a hard time evolving complex structures, because only specific structures work
    NEAT fixed this with "historical marking"? and "species"?
    early neurevolution was big in robotics, games, biology
    these networks were small (e4 or e5 trainable params)

end "ave been known for decades1. Before about 2012, these algorithms did not perform well for neur"... this is sooo long
